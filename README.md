3. Distance and duration are automatically calculated
4. The drive is saved to your history

### Verifying a Drive

3. Tap "Add Verification"
4. Enter verifier's initials (required)
5. Add optional comments
6. Tap "Verify"

### Exporting Data

1. Scroll to "Export Data" section
2. Choose format:
   - **TXT**: Plain text file with all drive details

4. Share or print as needed

### Tracking Progress

- **Total Hours**: Shows progress towards 50-hour requirement
- **Night Hours**: Shows progress towards 10-hour night driving requirement
- **Achievements**: Earn badges for milestones (10 hrs, 25 hrs, 50 hrs, etc.)
- **Stats**: View total drives, verified drives, and hours remaining

### Restoring and Backing Up Data

1. Use **Add a Past Drive** for a drive that was not recorded live.
2. Mark the source as **PDF-backed** or **Reconstructed estimate**.
3. Use **Download JSON Backup** regularly. Unlike PDF/TXT exports, JSON backups can be restored into the app.
4. Use **Restore JSON Backup** to add missing records. Exact duplicates are skipped and existing records are never overwritten.

## Customization 🎨

### Change Total Hour Requirements

Edit `app/components/ProgressDashboard.tsx`:

```typescript
const totalProgress = Math.min((totalHours / 50) * 100, 100); // Change 50
const nightProgress = Math.min((nightHours / 10) * 100, 100);  // Change 10
```

### Change Night Hours Definition

Edit `lib/location.ts`:

```typescript
export const isNightTime = (date: Date = new Date()): boolean => {
  const hour = date.getHours();
  return hour >= 18 || hour < 6; // Change 18 (6 PM) and 6 (6 AM)
};
```

### Update App Colors

Edit `tailwind.config.ts` to change the primary color scheme.

### Add More Badges

Edit `app/components/ProgressDashboard.tsx` in the `getBadges()` function.

## Troubleshooting 🔧

### GPS Not Working

- Ensure location services are enabled in iPhone Settings
- Check Safari has location permission
- Must use HTTPS (Vercel provides this automatically)
- GPS requires clear view of sky for accuracy

### App Not Installing on iPhone

- Must be accessed via Safari (not Chrome or Firefox on iOS)
- Must be deployed with HTTPS (http:// won't work)
- Check manifest.json is accessible at `/manifest.json`

### Data Not Saving

- Check browser console for errors
- IndexedDB must be supported (all modern browsers support it)
- Ensure sufficient storage space on device
- Try clearing browser cache and reloading

### Export Not Working

- Check browser allows downloads
- Disable popup blockers
- Try different format (PDF vs TXT)

## Development 💻

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm start` - Run production build locally
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

### Adding Features

Some ideas for enhancements:

- Add map view showing drive routes
- Implement cloud backup/sync
- Add multiple driver support
- Create detailed analytics and insights
- Add photo uploads for each drive
- Implement parent/teen user roles
- Add practice skill tracking (parking, highway, etc.)

## Browser Support 🌐

- **iOS Safari**: 12+
- **Chrome**: 60+
- **Firefox**: 60+
- **Edge**: 79+

**Note**: GPS tracking requires HTTPS and may not work on some browsers/devices.

## Privacy & Data 🔒

- **All data stored locally** on the device using IndexedDB
- **No server-side storage** or external database
- **No user accounts** or authentication required
- **Location data** never leaves the device
- **No analytics** or tracking
- **Open source** - all code is visible and auditable
